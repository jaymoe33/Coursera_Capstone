However, the two citites posess two distinct cultural identities. In this project, the cities' neighborhoods and venues will be analyzed to determine similarities and differences that contribute to or refute the idea of these cities separate identities. By comparing the two cities, we will be able to determine the best location for one to relocate to based on their interests and career and life goals. "
